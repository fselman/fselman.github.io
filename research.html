	<h1>The central density of R136 in 30 Doradus</h1>
	<p>The central density, ρ0, of a stellar cluster is an important physical parameter for determining its evolutionary and dynamical state. How much mass segregation there is or whether the cluster has undergone core collapse both depend on ρ0. In <a href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2013A%26A...552A..94S"> Selman and Melnick 2013</a> we reanalyze the results of a previous paper that gives the mass density profile of R136 and combine them with both a conservative upper limit for the core parameter and a more uncertain recent measurement. We thus place a lower limit on ρ0 under reasonable and defensible assumptions about the IMF, finding ρ0 ≥ 1.5 × 104 M⊙/pc3 for the conservative assumption a less than 0.4 pc for the cluster core parameter. If we use the lower, but more uncertain value a = 0.025 pc, the central density estimate becomes greater than 10^7 M⊙/pc3. A mechanism based on the destruction of a large number of circumstellar disks is posited to explain the hitherto unexplained increase in reddening presented in that same work. 

        <h1>The stellar initial mass function of the Arches cluster.</h1>
	<p>After showing that the field of the LMC has an IMF with an upper mass slope consistent with the Salpeter one, we approached the other emblematic cluster for which a deviant value has been claimed. We have shown that the IMF slope in the upper mass range is also consitent with the Salpeter value. The details can be found in <a href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2009arXiv0903.2222E"> Espinoza, Selman and Melnick (2009)</a>. You can see an <a href="http://www.eso.org/public/chile/news/eso0921/"> ESO press release.</a> </p>

	<h1>Scale free star cluster mass function and a universal stellar IMF in clusters and the field.</h1>
	<p>After having determined that the stellar population in the field and in the ionizing cluster of 30 Doradus both have a Salpeter slope IMF we have discussed the implications in the context of Kroupa and Weidner's arguments against the field IMF being the same as that of the IMF of stars in clusters. We presented our arguments in Protostars and Planets VI (Hawaii, 2005), and can be found published in <a href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2008ApJ...689..816S/"> Selman and Melnick 2008</a>. We have refined the study since then, recognizing the significance of the statistics of the maximal star mass-cluster mass presented by Weidner and Kroupa by reproducing their results with our own simulations. The figure shows the contour map of this statistics showing the area permitted by the purely random sampling model but not covered by observations.</p>

	<h1>Intergalactic light in clusters of galaxies.</h1>
	<p>With Hernan Quintana from PUC and J. Melnick at ESO I have developed a technique to analyze imaging data in the optical in a manner analogous to that used in the infrared permitting accurate sky subtraction. The technical details are found in <a href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/1999PASP..111.1444M">Melnick, Selman, and Quintana (1999)</a>. We are currently applying this technique to study the distribution of light in two clusters of galaxies. Preliminary results were presented in <a href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2007A%26A...463..833F">A&A 463, 833 (2007)</a>, and a more complete account in <a href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2011MNRAS.414..602T">Toledo et al. 2011</a>.</p>

	<h1>30 Doradus: star formation history and IMF.</h1>
	<p>We have recently found that between 7 and 40 solar masses the stellar IMF in the field of the 30 Doradus superassociation has a Salpeter slope. Dor details see <a href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2005A%26A...443..851S">Selman and Melnick 2005</a>.</p>

	<p>With Jorge Melnick, Roberto Terlevich and Guillermo Bosch we have written a series of papers on the properties of the ionizing cluster of 30 Doradus. <a href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/1999A%26A...341...98S">Paper I</a> deals with the data analysis and the distribution of reddening; <a href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/1999A%26AS..137...21B">Paper II</a>, written by Bosch et al. deals with the spectroscopic study of the massive stellar population; <a href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/1999A%26A...347..532S">Paper III,</a> by Selman et al. deals with the IMF and star formation history; and <a href="http://esoads.eso.org/abs/2001A%26A...380..137B">Paper IV,</a> by Bosch et al. started as an attempt to study the dynamics of the cluster and ended being a study of the binary fraction.</p>

	<h1>Visualization of scientific data.</h1>
	<p>When the amount of data to be analyzed is large it becomes imperative to have powerful means of visualization. I am developing tools based on VTK, and written in C++, Tcl, and Python to visualize the large amounts of data that come out of WFI. You can see an example in the previous section. Here I present a slightly more elaborated one in which I super-impose on the data the <a href="images/evol.jpeg">evolutionary track of a 12Msun star.</a> The color of the tube represents the luminosity class: I, red; III, yellow; and V, blue; the width of the track represents the speed at which the star is traveling in the stereogram, as it evolves. I have painted the star of different colors according to their V magnitude so that they can retain this information when seen from <a href="images/cc.jpeg">another perspective.</a></p>
